Assignment 2.2
As shown in the graph plot_sum_performance.png the time of the Matrix seems following an exponential growth, instead
the SparseMatrix seems more linear.
We can conclude that, for large matrixes of size greater than 200, the SparseMatrix implementation is better than
the Matrix one for computing the sum.
